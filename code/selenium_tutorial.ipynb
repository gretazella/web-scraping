    "Traditional scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup work well for static HTML, but they fall short on dynamic sites where content loads via user interactions (e.g., scrolling, clicking filters). Selenium bridges this gap by automating a real web browser, simulating human actions like navigating pages, clicking buttons, and waiting for elements to load. In this tutorial we are going to scrape the website \"Ground News\" using Selenium and JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ground News is a unique platform that aggregates news articles from thousands of sources, rating them for bias (left, center, right) and factuality. This makes it an ideal case study for examining media polarization, sentiment analysis, visualizing bias distribution and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to collect comprehensive information on news articles related to Artificial Intelligence, including the article titles, their summaries, and the media bias ratings associated with each source. This data will be organized and saved into a CSV file for easy analysis and future reference."
